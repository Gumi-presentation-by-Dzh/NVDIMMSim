Acknowledgements:
	General design (anything not flash specific) borrows heavily from DRAMSim Copyright (C) 2008-2009 Elliot Cooper-Balis and Paul Rosenfeld (overall structure is very similar and some code snippets and classes are copypasta).

Getting started:
	way too early in development... Check back later
